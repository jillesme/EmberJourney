## EmberJourney

I will learn something about Ember every day. Progress can be checked here!
At the moment I know absolutely nothing about Ember.

## Installing 

If you want to check out what I have been doing for some reason, just do a bower install
and `python -m SimpleHTTPServer "8080"`. Then navigate to localhost:8080.
