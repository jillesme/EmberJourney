## EmberJourney

I will learn something about Ember every day. Progress can be checked here!
At the moment I know absolutely nothing about Ember.

## Installing 

If you want to check out what I have been doing for some reason, just do a bower install
and `python -m SimpleHTTPServer "8080"`. Then navigate to localhost:8080.

## The end

To be fair I like Ember but it's just no stable enough for me right now. There's an issue with handlebars in chrome and version 2.0 will have some new cool features. I'll wait for Ember v2 and start this repo from scratch again!
